## Introduction: 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

### Import Data
```{r data prep}
stroke_df = read.csv("./data/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv")
# head(stroke_df)
stroke_df$stroke = as.factor(stroke_df$stroke)

stroke_df = stroke_df %>% 
    mutate(stroke = recode(stroke, 
                           `0` = "no stroke", 
                           `1` = "stroke")) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    select(-id) 

summary(stroke_df)

sapply("N/A", grepl, x=stroke_df)
bmi.index = stroke_df %>% filter(stroke_df$bmi == "N/A")
dim(bmi.index)
bmi.index %>% 
    filter(bmi.index$stroke == "stroke") %>% 
    dim()

```
The imported dataset has 5110 observations in total. Excluding the id, we only gave 10 features and one binary outcome variable-stroke (0:no stroke, 1:stroke). We found that the stroke outcome distribution is imbalanced with 4861 observations have no stroke while 249 observations have a stroke.

We find out there are 201 observations with missing values in BMI. Among these missing values, 40 observations have a stroke while 161 observations without stroke. 

Our main task for this project is to find out the appropriate models that have a better performance on prediction by comparing several models' performance. 

First, we have to figure out how to deal with the missing values, since the missing data reside only in the BMI variable, and it is a continuous variable. We can discuss how to impute these values. Plus, we will also examine if there is any correlation among features. 

Second, we have to handle the imbalanced distribution among stroke and non-stroke groups. The imbalance distribution problem can be solved via the sampling method in cross-validation.

Third, the characteristics of features will help us determine which model would be proper. As the outcome is binary, and the features are mixtures of continuous and categorical variables. In the meanwhile, we also have to decide how to partition the train and test data, which cross-validation method to use, which evaluation metrics should be used, and set up a reasonable tuning grid corresponding to the tuning parameter.
